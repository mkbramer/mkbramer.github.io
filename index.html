    <h1>MK &#129415; Bramer</h1>

    <p>I am a 20 year old VCD major with a minor in Creative Writing. I live with my partner and 2 cats, Bucky & Goomba. </p>

    <h2>Origin Story</h2>

    <p>I am the art child of my family. For Christmas I received the cheap art kits with the markers that dried out too fast. I always loved art, drawing, and most of all, stories.  In my sophomore year of college I went through a quarter life that almost WWE body slammed me into academic suspension and left me without a clue of what I was going to do with my life.</p>

    <h3>SUPER POWER</h3>
<p>My ability to hyper-focus on a story. From movies to books to my own original characters.</p>
