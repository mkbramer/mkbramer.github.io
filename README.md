# MK Bramer

I am 20 and live with my partner and 2 cats, Bucky and Goomba. My hobbies include videogames, writing, and outdoor recreation. My favorite music genres are goth and new wave and my favorite artist of all time is Hozier. Currently I've been very interested in the art and themes of Batman comics. 

## Major
I am a VCD major with a Creative Writing minor.
