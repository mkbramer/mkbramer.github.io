    <h1>MK &#129415; Bramer</h1>

    <p>I am a 20 year old VCD major with a minor in Creative Writing. I live with my partner and 2 cats, Bucky & Goomba. </p>

    <h2>Origin Story</h2>

    <p>I am the art child of my family. For Christmas I received the cheap art kits with the markers that dried out too fast. I always loved art, drawing, and most of all, stories. I was also a Straight-A Student until my sophomore year of college; I went through a quarter-life crisis that almost WWE-body-slammed me into academic suspension and left me without a clue of what I wanted to do in life. I bounced between majors for a bit, I started with TEFL, then went to Teaching, then English, then Creative Writing, and then I finally decided I wanted to do something I was passionate about without being a starving artist, and that led me to Graphic Design, and I love it! 

        Today I mostly spend my days between school, the front desk at the hotel I work for, and at home with my partner and two kitties. Writing is my biggest hobby, but I also love to watch TV and movies, play videogames, read, and create art. I also love outdoor recreation, especially camping.
